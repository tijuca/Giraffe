/* 
 * How we run subqueries assumes the following:
 * - SubSubRestrictions are invalid
 * - The most efficient way to run a search with a subquery is to first evaluate the subquery and THEN the
 *   main query
 *
 * We number subqueries in a query in a depth-first order. The numbering can be used because we don't have
 * nested subqueries (see above). Each subquery can therefore be pre-calculated for each item in the main
 * query target. The results of the subqueries is then passed to the main query solver, which only needs
 * to check the outcome of a subquery.
