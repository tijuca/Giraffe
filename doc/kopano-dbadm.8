.TH kopano\-dbadm 8 "2018-04-11" "Kopano 8" "Kopano Groupware Core reference"
.SH Name
kopano\-dbadm \(em database administration utility
.SH Synopsis
\fBkopano\-dbadm\fP [\fB\-c\fP \fIserver.cfg\fP] \fIaction\fP...
.SH Description
.PP
This tool is for special surgical tasks on the Kopano SQL database.
\fBkopano\-server ought to be stopped when running this utility\fP, unless
otherwise noted. You should make a database backup first.
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIserver.cfg\fP
By default, kopano\-dbadm will read /etc/kopano/server.cfg for MySQL
connection parameters, but an alternate file may be specified.
.SH Actions
.SS k\-1216
.PP
This is an alias for the combination of: index\-tags, np\-remove\-highid,
np\-remove\-unused, np\-repair\-dups, np\-defrag, rm\-helper\-index. It may be
used to address the K-1216 issue that kopano\-server(8) may report when
performing a schema update. If the tag indices already exist, harmless warnings
will show, but the indices will be used and left as-is after the k\-1216 action
is done.
.SS np\-defrag
.PP
Compact the ID space in the namedproperties table and lowers the
AUTO_INCREMENT value, thereby making IDs actually usable after a remove
operation (such as np\-remove\-xh).
.SS np\-remove\-highid
.PP
Remove all named property mappings with internal ID higher than 31485. As
Kopano/Zarafa MAPI clients cannot handle these IDs anyway, the IDs are never
used to store any data and only occupy the ID space needlessy.
.SS np\-remove\-unused
.PP
Remove all named property mappings that have zero use counts in other tables.
.SS np\-remove\-xh
.PP
kopano\-dagent(8) used to index all X-Headers from Internet e-mails by default,
but administrators may not have needed this information in the first place. By
using np\-remove\-xh, all named properties whose name starts with "X\-" and
have GUID=PS_INTERNET_HEADERS are removed. np\-defrag should be run afterwards.
.SS np\-repair\-dups
.PP
Repairs duplicate named properties (only IDs below or equal to 31485).
.SS np\-stat
.PP
Show statistics for the namedproperties table. This action can be executed
while kopano\-server is active.
.SS index\-tags
.PP
Create helper indices for the "tag" columns. This action can be executed while
kopano\-server is active.
.SS rm\-helper\-index
.PP
Remove helper indices again. This action can be executed while kopano\-server
is active.
.SH Performance
.PP
Totally depends on the amount of data that needs to be moved. MySQL also seems
to process the requests single-threadedly. An i7-3930K completed a
naturally-evolved DB (4.96 GiB, properties: 12.94M rows, tproperties: 9.65M
rows, mvproperties: 9.9K rows, indexedproperties: 3.24M rows, singleinstances:
188K rows, names: 2988) using the "k\-1216" command combo within 2 minutes and
The "np\-remove\-xh, np\-defrag" combo within 5 1/2 minutes.
.PP
An approximate row count of a table can be retrieved with \fBSHOW TABLE STATUS
LIKE "\fP\fIproperties\fP\fB"\fP. For an exact count, use \fBSELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `\fP\fIproperties\fP\fB`\fP.
