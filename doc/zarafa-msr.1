.SH "NAME"
zarafa-msr \- Relocates mailboxes from one node to another.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 11
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR [\fICONFIG\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
In order to move mailboxes between multi\-server nodes, the mailbox storage relocator is available\&. The
\fBzarafa\-msr \fR
tool should be used to relocate mailboxes to other multi\-server nodes\&.
.SH "INVOCATION"
.PP
The only argument required by
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
is an configuration file specifying the details of the relocation operation\&.
.PP
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
\fICONFIG\fR
.PP
When
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
is finished with relocating all mailboxes, it will print
.PP
"x migrations have completed successfully, maintaining sync\&."
.PP
where x denotes the number of migrated mailboxes\&. The administrator can now stop
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
by pressing Ctrl\-C\&.
.PP
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
can safely be stopped at any time by pressing Ctrl\-C\&. On the next run it will continue where it left off when it was stopped\&.
.SH "UPDATING LDAP/ADS"
.PP
There are two situations in which it\(cqs safe to update the home servers for the users whose mailboxes have been relocated:
.PP
1\&.
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
is still running\&. In this case all changes in the original mailbox will continue to be propagated to the new mailbox\&.
.PP
2\&. No changes in the original mailbox can occur\&.
.PP
NOTE: Running
\fBzarafa\-msr\fR
after the LDAP/ADS has been modified will not work, because it will automatically connect to the new server for the source mailbox\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
