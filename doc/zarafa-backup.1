.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBzarafa\-backup\fR\ 'u
\fBzarafa\-backup\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The zarafa\-backup tool creates a backup of a store\&. The data of emails, calender items, contacts, etc\&. are stored in a binary file\&. You can use the zarafa\-restore tool to retreive backed up items\&.
.PP
Some items are not backed up, like the rules created by the user, specific view information, selected sorting, etc\&.
.PP
Therefore, this backup tool cannot be used as a disaster recovery method\&. Please refer to the \*(AqZarafa Backup & Performance\*(Aq documentation on the Zarafa site for common available backup methods\&.
.PP
The backup tool currently automatically detects if a full backup or an incremental backup is possible\&. This may change in the future\&.
.SH "INDEX FILE LAYOUT"
.PP
The backup tool will create 2 files for each store that is backed up\&. username\&.data\&.zbk will contain the data of the store\&. username\&.index\&.zbk is an text index of data data file\&. The file contains a number of fields per line, separated by a colon\&. The first field is either \*(AqR\*(Aq (root), \*(AqC\*(Aq (container) or \*(AqM\*(Aq (message)\&. The Root line contains 4 fields:
.PP
1st field: marker
.RS 4
R: Root marker
.RE

2nd field: unique id length
.RS 4
[0\-9]+: number of characters in following id
.RE
