.PP
\fBspooler\&.cfg\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
spooler\&.cfg

.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality\&.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR

.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:

\fBfax_domain\fR
.RS 4
When an email is sent to a contact with a FAX type email address, the address will be rewritten to a normal SMTP address, using the scheme: <faxnumber>@<fax_domain>\&. You can install software in your SMTP server which handles these email addresses to actually fax the message to that number\&.

.PP
\fBalways_send_delegates\fR
.RS 4
Normally, a user needs to give explicit rights to other users to be able to send under their name\&. When setting this value to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq, the spooler will not check these permissions, and will always send the email with \*(AqOn behalf of\*(Aq headers\&. Please note that this feature overrides \*(Aqsend\-as\*(Aq functionality\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBalways_send_tnef\fR
.RS 4
Meeting requests will be sent using iCalendar files\&. This adds compatibility to more calendar programs\&. To use the previous TNEF (winmail\&.dat) method, set this option to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq\&.
.sp
When an email body is written in RTF text, normally this data is sent using TNEF\&. If you want to send an HTML representation of the email instead and not use TNEF, set this to \*(Aqminimal\*(Aq\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBalways_send_utf8\fR
.RS 4
E\-mails can be sent in any charset that the e\-mail was written in\&. It may be desirable to always send in the UTF\-8 charset, which may be more widely supported\&. To enable e\-mail to always be sent in the utf\-8 charset, set this option to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBenable_dsn\fR
.RS 4
Enable the Delivery Status Notifications (DSN) for users\&. If a user requests a DSN the spooler sends the request to the MTA and when the MTA support this the user will receive the report in the mailbox\&. When the MTA doesn\*(Aqt support DSN the user will not receive a report\&. Ensure you have a supported MTA like postfix 2\&.3 and higher\&. If DSN is disabled and the user request a DSN then it will be ignored and the delivery report is not sent\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBcharset_upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Upgrades the us\-ascii charset to this charset\&. This makes sure high\-characters in recipients and attachment filenames are correctly sent when the body is in plain text\&. Not used when always_send_utf8 is enabled\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIwindows\-1252\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_redirect_spoofing\fR
.RS 4
Normally, users are not allowed to send e\-mail from a different e\-mail address than their own\&. However, the \*(Aqredirect\*(Aq rule sends e\-mails with their original \*(Aqfrom\*(Aq address\&. Enabling this option allows redirected e\-mails to be sent with their original \*(Aqfrom\*(Aq e\-mail address\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBcopy_delegate_mails\fR
.RS 4
Make a copy of the sent mail of delegates in the sent items folder of the representee\&. This is done for both delegate and send\-as e\-mails\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_delegate_meeting_request\fR
.RS 4
Normally, users are not allowed to send meeting requests as external delegate\&. However, when you want to forward meeting requests you need delegate permissions\&. Enabling this option allows you to sent and forward a meeting request as a delegate Kopano and SMTP user\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_send_to_everyone\fR
.RS 4
When set to \*(Aqno\*(Aq, sending to the \*(Aqeveryone\*(Aq group is disallowed\&. The entire message will be bounced if this is attempted\&. When set to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq, this allows sending to all users in the \*(Aqeveryone\*(Aq group\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBexpand_groups\fR
.RS 4
Expand groups in headers of sent e\-mails\&. This means that the recipient of an e\-mail with one or more groups as recipients will see the members of the groups instead of the groups themselves\&. If a group has an e\-mail address, the group is not expanded irrespective of this setting, since having an e\-mail address for the group implies that this address can be used to send messages to the group\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBarchive_on_send\fR
.RS 4
Archive outgoing messages\&. If an archive is attached to the mailbox from which a message is send, the message will immediately be archived to the special Outgoing folder\&.
.sp
Messages that are archived this way are not attached to the original message in the primary store\&. So there\*(Aqs no easy way to find the original sent item based on an archive or find an archive based on the sent item in the primary store\&. This option is only intended to make sure all outgoing messages are stored without the possibility for the owner to delete them\&.
