\fBname\fR

.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:

.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_user\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the spooler process will become this user, dropping root privileges\&. Note that the log file needs to be writeable by this user, and the directory too to create new logfiles after logrotation\&. This can also be achieved by setting the correct group and permissions\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the user after starting\&.

.sp
Default:
\fI5\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBfax_domain\fR
.RS 4
When an email is sent to a contact with a FAX type email address, the address will be rewritten to a normal SMTP address, using the scheme: <faxnumber>@<fax_domain>\&. You can install software in your SMTP server which handles these email addresses to actually fax the message to that number\&.
.sp
Default:
.RE
.PP
\fBfax_international\fR

When sending an international fax, the number will start with a \'+\' sign\&. You can rewrite this to the digits you need to dial when dialing to another country\&.
.sp

\fI+\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBalways_send_delegates\fR
.RS 4
Normally, a user needs to give explicit rights to other users to be able to send under their name\&. When setting this value to \'yes\', the spooler will not check these permissions, and will always send the email with \'On behalf of\' headers\&. This was the default behaviour in installations before Zarafa 6\&.20\&. Please note that this feature overrides \'send\-as\' functionality\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBalways_send_tnef\fR
.RS 4
Since Zarafa 6\&.30, meeting requests will be sent using iCalendar files\&. This adds compatibility to more calendar programs\&. To use the previous TNEF (winmail\&.dat) method, set this option to \'yes\'\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBalways_send_utf8\fR
.RS 4
E\-mails can be sent in any charset that the e\-mail was written in\&. It may be desirable to always send in the UTF\-8 charset, which may be more widely supported\&. To enable e\-mail to always be sent in the utf\-8 charset, set this option to \'yes\'\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBcharset_upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Upgrades the us\-ascii charset to this charset\&. This makes sure high\-characters in recipients and attachment filenames are correctly sent when the body is in plain text\&. Not used when always_send_utf8 is enabled\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIwindows\-1252\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_redirect_spoofing\fR
.RS 4
Normally, users are not allowed to send e\-mail from a different e\-mail address than their own\&. However, the \'redirect\' rule sends e\-mails with their original \'from\' address\&. Enabling this option allows redirected e\-mails to be sent with their original \'from\' e\-mail address\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBcopy_delegate_mails\fR
.RS 4
Make a copy of the sent mail of delegates in the sent items folder of the representee\&. This is done for both delegate and send\-as e\-mails\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_delegate_meeting_request\fR
.RS 4
Normally, users are not allowed to send meeting requests as external delegate\&. However, when you want to forward meeting requests you need delegate permissions\&. Enabling this option allows you to sent and forward a meeting request as a delegate Zarafa and SMTP user\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_send_to_everyone\fR
.RS 4
When set to \'no\', sending to the \'everyone\' group is disallowed\&. The entire message will be bounced if this is attempted\&. When set to \'yes\', this allows sending to all users in the \'everyone\' group\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBexpand_groups\fR
.RS 4
Expand groups in headers of sent e\-mails\&. This means that the recipient of an e\-mail with one or more groups as recipients will see the members of the groups instead of the groups themselves\&. If a group has an e\-mail address, the group is not expanded irrespective of this setting, since having an e\-mail address for the group implies that this address can be used to send messages to the group\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBarchive_on_send\fR
.RS 4
Archive outgoing messages\&. If an archive is attached to the mailbox from which a message is send, the message will immediately be archived to the special Outgoing folder\&.
.sp
Messages that are archived this way are not attached to the original message in the primary store\&. So there\'s no easy way to find the original sent item based on an archive or find an archive based on the sent item in the primary store\&. This option is only intended to make sure all outgoing messages are stored without the possibility for the owner to delete them\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
