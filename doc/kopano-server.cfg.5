.SH "NAME"
kopano-server.cfg \- The Kopano configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBserver.cfg\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
server.cfg
is a configuration file for the kopano\-server process.
server.cfg
contains instructions for the software to set up the database environment, logging system and user backend.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR
=
\fIvalue\fR
.PP
The file is line\-based. Each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, nothing, a parameter or a directive. A line beginning with `#\*(Aq is considered a comment, and will be ignored by Kopano. Parameter names are case sensitive. Lines beginning with `!\*(Aq are directives.
.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:
.PP
\fBinclude\fR
.RS 4
Include and process
\fIargument\fR
.sp
Example: !include common.cfg
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF THE SERVER SETTINGS PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBserver_bind\fR
.RS 4
IP address to bind to. Leave empty to bind to all addresses. Keep in mind that both Webaccess and Outlook must be able to connect. The Webaccess normally connects on ::1/127.0.0.1, and Outlook from remote networks.
.sp
Default: (empty)
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_tcp_enabled\fR
.RS 4
Enable direct TCP connections.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_tcp_port\fR
.RS 4
Port to listen on.
.sp
Default:
\fI236\fR

.PP
\fBserver_pipe_enabled\fR
.RS 4
Enable Unix pipe connections. Should not be disabled.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_recv_timeout\fR
.RS 4
TCP and SSL receive timeout in seconds. This is the time that a TCP connection may be idle (between requests) before the TCP connection is closed from the server. Settings this high makes it less necessary for clients to re\-connect, but increases the total number of concurrent open sockets in the server. You normally needn\*(Aqt change the default value.
.sp
Default:
\fI5\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_read_timeout\fR
.RS 4
TCP and SSL read timeout in seconds. The read timeout is the amount of time that the server will wait to read more data from a socket, after processing of the request has started. This needn\*(Aqt be changed in most cases.
.sp
Default:
\fI60\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_send_timeout\fR
.RS 4
TCP and SSL send timeout in seconds. The send timeout is the amount of time that the server will wait to write data to a socket, analogous to server_read_timeout.
.sp
Default:
\fI60\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_max_keep_alive_requests\fR
.RS 4
Limits the number of requests allowed per connection.
.sp
Default:
\fI100\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_pipe_name\fR
.RS 4
Unix socket to listen on.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/run/kopano/server.sock\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_pipe_priority\fR
.RS 4
Priority unix socket to listen on. This socket should only be used by prioritized services such as kopano\-stats.

\fI/var/run/kopano/prio.sock\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_name\fR
.RS 4
Unique name for identifying the server in a multi\-server environment.
.sp
Default:
\fIKopano\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_hostname\fR
.RS 4

.PP
\fBdatabase_engine\fR
.RS 4
The database engine to use. Values can be:
.PP
\fImysql\fR
.RS 4
Use MySQL.
.RE
.sp
Default:
\fImysql\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallow_local_users\fR
.RS 4
Named Unix users which connect through the unix socket (server_pipe_name) which are added here, those users will become the internal SYSTEM user in Kopano, and have administrative rights. Normally, this is only \*(Aqroot\*(Aq, so the unix root user can use the kopano\-admin tool. You can add a generic user to be used by the kopano\-dagent here. This user is most likely called \*(Aqvmail\*(Aq. Note that the field is SPACE separated.
.sp
Default:
\fIroot\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBsystem_email_address\fR
.RS 4
This is the e\-mail address of the SYSTEM user. When people receive mail from the quota monitor, or receive fallback deliveries from the kopano\-dagent, the From email address is this field. You might want to change this field so people can reply to this address.
.sp
Default:
\fIpostmaster@localhost\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_user\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the server process will become this user, dropping root privileges. Note that the log file needs to be writeable by this user, and the directory too to create new logfiles after logrotation. This can also be achieved by setting the correct group and permissions.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the user after starting.
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_group\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the server process will become this group, dropping root privileges.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the group after starting.
.RE
.PP
\fBpid_file\fR
.RS 4
Write the process ID number to this file. This is used by the init.d script to correctly stop/restart the service.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/run/kopano/server.pid\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrunning_path\fR
.RS 4
Change directory to this path when running in daemonize mode. When using the \-F switch to run in the foreground the directory will not be changed.
.sp
Default:
\fI/\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBcoredump_enabled\fR
.RS 4
When a crash occurs or an assertion fails, a coredump file can be generated.
This file should be sent along with the crash report. It is turned on by
default in Kopano, but your system may have it disabled. For details, see the
\fBkopano\-coredump\fP(5) manpage.
.RE
.PP
\fBsession_timeout\fR
.RS 4
The session timeout specifies how many seconds must elapse without any activity from a client before the server counts the session as dead. The client sends keepalive requests every 60 seconds, so the session timeout can never be below 60. In fact, if you specify a timeout below 300, 300 will be taken as the session timeout instead. This makes sure you can never timeout your session while the Kopano client is running.
.sp
Setting the session timeout low will keep the session count and therefore the memory usage on the server low, but may also timeout sessions of client that have lost network connectivity temporarily. For example, some clients with powersaving modes will disable the ethernet card during the screensaver. When this happens, you must set the session_timeout to a value that is higher than the time that it takes for the network connection to come back. This could be anything ranging up to several hours.
.sp
Default:
\fI300\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBsession_ip_check\fR
.RS 4
Normally, a session is linked to an IP\-address, so this check is enabled. You may want to disable this check when you have laptop\*(Aqs which can get multiple ip\-adresses through wired and wireless networks. It is highly recommended to leave this check enabled, since the session id can be used by other machines, and thus introduces a large security risc. The session id is 64 bits.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBhide_everyone\fR
.RS 4
If this option is set to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq, the internal group Everyone (which always contains all users) will be hidden from the Global Addressbook. Thus, users will not be able to send e\-mail to this group anymore, and also will not be able to set access rights on folders for this group. Administrators will still be able to see and use the group.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBhide_system\fR
.RS 4
If this option is set to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq, the internal user SYSTEM will be hidden from the Global Addressbook. Thus, users will not be able to send e\-mail to this user anymore. Administrators will still be able to see and use the user.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBallocator_library\fR
.RS 4
This setting allows one to preload a special library (such as an allocator). On startup, the server will set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable for itself and then re\-execute itself to get it loaded with high priority. If this option is empty, the default system allocator (from libc) will be used instead, which is probably a better choice when debugging with gdb, valgrind or ASAN/UBSAN. The environment variable KC_ALLOCATOR_DONE may also be set to a non\-empty value to disable re\-exec.

\fBattachment_storage\fR
.RS 4
The location where attachments are stored. This can be in the MySQL database, or as separate files. The drawback of \*(Aqdatabase\*(Aq is that the large data of attachment will push useful data from the MySQL cache. The drawback of separate files is that a mysqldump is not enough for a full disaster recovery.

When the attachment_storage option is \*(Aqfiles\*(Aq, this option controls the compression level for the attachments. Higher compression levels will compress data better, but at the cost of CPU usage. Lower compression levels will require less CPU but will compress data less. Setting the compression level to 0 will effectively disable compression completely.

Normally, admin users are granted all permissions on all stores in the server, or for stores in the tenant\*(Aqs company (in multi\-tenant mode). Enabling this option restricts permissions to folder operations: Folder viewing, folder creation and importantly, folder permissions. This means that an administrator can grant himself full permissions on a folder. However, in combination with auditing, it provides an extra level of security protection against unwanted access.

When set to \*(Aqyes\*(Aq, kopano will synchronize the local user list whenever a list of users is requested (eg during kopano\-admin \-l or when opening the addressbook).

The counter_reset option forces a recount of items in the folder each time a folder is opened. Although this is not strictly necessary, it is a precaution to make sure that counters are always correct. When enabled, this does incur a performance penalty, especially on large (>50000 items) folders. Each time a counter_reset found an incorrect item count, it increments the system statistic counter_resyncs. If it is at 0 on your system, then this option has had no effect except for slowing it down.

\fBproxy_header\fR
.RS 4
In normal operation, a cluster of kopano\-server nodes is served by sending redirections back to the clients requesting information. The redirection URL is built from the server\*(Aqs information in the LDAP database. However, in some cases it is useful to place the kopano\-server instances behind a reverse HTTP proxy. In this case the redirected URL returned to the client cannot be the \*(Aqnormal\*(Aq hostname, but must be a URL that is handled by the proxy.
.sp
However, internal (\*(Aqbehind\*(Aq the proxy) redirections must *not* be redirected to the proxy since this is not necessary. The strategy is that kopano\-server will redirect to the proxy URL if the connection that initiated the redirect passed through a proxy. The way that this is detected is by examining an HTTP header. If the header specified by this option is found, then redirections will be to the proxy. If it is not, then redirections will be to the internal host. If the special value \*(Aq*\*(Aq is specified for this option, then the proxy URL will always be used. Specifying an empty value disables proxy detection.
.sp
Another effect of this option is that when a proxy connection is detected, kopano\-server attempts to use the \*(AqX\-Forwarded\-For\*(Aq header to determine the originating IP address. This is used for logging and session binding (a session initiated on a certain IP address may not be accessed from another IP address).
