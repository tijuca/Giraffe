.SH "NAME"
zarafa-dagent.cfg \- The Zarafa dagent configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBdagent\&.cfg\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fIdagent\&.cfg\fR
is a configuration file for the Zarafa Dagent\&.
\fIdagent\&.cfg\fR
contains instructions for the software to set up the logging system and LMTP settings\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality\&.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR
=
\fIvalue\fR
.PP
The file is line\-based\&. Each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, nothing, a parameter or a directive\&. A line beginning with `#\' is considered a comment, and will be ignored by Zarafa\&. Parameter names are case sensitive\&. Lines beginning with `!\' are directives\&.
.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:
.PP
\fBinclude\fR
.RS 4
Include and process
\fIargument\fR
.sp
Example: !include common\&.cfg
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF EACH PARAMETER"
.PP
\fBserver_bind\fR

.sp
Default:
\fIfile:///var/run/zarafa\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_user\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the dagent process will become this user, dropping root privileges\&. Note that the log file needs to be writeable by this user, and the directory too to create new logfiles after logrotation\&. This can also be achieved by setting the correct group and permissions\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the user after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_group\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the dagent process will become this group, dropping root privileges\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the group after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpid_file\fR
.RS 4
Write the process ID number to this file\&. This is used by the init\&.d script to correctly stop/restart the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/run/zarafa\-dagent\&.pid\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBsslkey_file\fR
.RS 4
Use this file as key to logon to the server\&. This is only used when server_socket is set to an HTTPS transport\&. See the

\fBprocess_model\fR
.RS 4
You can change the process model between
\fIfork\fR
and
\fIthread\fR\&. The forked model uses somewhat more resources, but if a crash is triggered, this will only affect one user\&. In the threaded model, a crash means all users are affected, and will not be able to use the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIfork\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlmtp_port\fR
.RS 4
Port to listen to for LMTP requests
.sp
Default:
\fI2003\fR
.RE

.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBspam_header_name\fR
.RS 4
To detect if the receiving mail is spam, the DAgent can check this header for a value that is in there\&. This name is case insensitive\&. If this option is empty, the detection method will be turned off\&. You can also force a delivery to the Junk Mail folder using the
\fI\-j\fR
commandline option\&.

\fBarchive_on_delivery\fR
.RS 4
Archive incoming message on delivery\&. If an archive is attached to the target mailbox, the message will immediately be archived upon delivery\&.
.sp

.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE

.sp
If the script is successful (exitcode is 0), then no other actions are performed (eg rules or vacation messages) and the message is not delivered in the inbox\&. If the script exits with a non\-zero exit code, rules and vacation messages are run as usual, and the message is delivered in the inbox (or other folder, depending on rules or options)\&.
