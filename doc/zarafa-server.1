.SH "NAME"
zarafa-server \- Start the Zarafa storage server\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBzarafa\-server\fR\ 'u
\fBzarafa\-server\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The zarafa\-server is the Zafara storage server\&. It contacts a database server and provides services to Zarafa clients\&. The user base can be retreived from an external source, like LDAP, or can be setup with a separate list of users\&.
.PP
After starting, the server keeps listening for connections on the configured TCP port and/or Unix socket\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The Zarafa server program takes the following configuration options:
.PP
\fB\-\-config\fR, \fB\-c\fR \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Specify the location of the configuration file\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/server\&.cfg\fR
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-foreground\fR, \fB\-F\fR
.RS 4
Run in the foreground\&. Normally the server will daemonize and run in the background\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-restart\-searches\fR, \fB\-R\fR
.RS 4
Rebuild all search folders\&. This may take some time and is only needed when your search folders have become out\-of\-sync with the actual data in the database\&. The sync will start synchronously at the start of the server, and you will have to wait for all searches to complete before connecting to the server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\-database\-version\-conflict\fR
.RS 4
Ignore version information from the database\&. Zarafa will normally not start the server if the database has a newer version than the zarafa\-server binary\&. This makes sure you cannot downgrade your server binary while keeping the same database\&. If you know what you\*(Aqre doing, you can use this option to bypass the start\-up version check of the database\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\-attachment\-storage\-conflict\fR
.RS 4
Override the attachment storage option from the configuration file\&. When you change the option of the location where to store attachments after you\*(Aqve already started the zarafa\-server once, this location will conflict\&. Attachments will not be found when they are stored in a different location\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-override\-multiserver\-lock\fR
.RS 4
When you upgrade/downgrade from/to multiserver setups, the server will not start, because of database differences\&. If you know what you\*(Aqre doing, and want to circumvent this and start the server anyway, you can use this option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-force\-database\-upgrade\fR
.RS 4
The upgrade from 6\&.x to 7\&.0 is blocked, since it will take a long time\&. We provide 2 methods to upgrade the database\&. One is using the preferred zarafa7\-upgrade python script\&. This is preferred since it shows the upgrade progress, and you can estimate the time it will take for the upgrade to complete\&. The second option is letting the zarafa\-server do the normal upgrade as usual\&. Pass this option to use this method\&. The server will only daemonize when the upgrade is complete\&. Simple progress can be followed in the log output of the server\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR
.RS 4
Print the version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
When invoked with no options, the server will search for a configuration file in
/etc/zarafa/server\&.cfg\&. If no configuration file is found, default values are used\&. See
\fBzarafa-server.cfg\fR(5)
for all configuration options and their default values\&.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
Starting the server with an alternative configuration:
.PP

\fBzarafa\-server\fR
\fB\-c\fR
\fI/path/to/server\&.cfg\fR
.PP
You may also use the init\&.d scripts:
.PP
\fB/etc/init\&.d/zarafa\-server\fR
[\fIstart\fR|
\fIstop\fR|
\fIrestart\fR]
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/etc/zarafa/server\&.cfg
.RS 4
The server configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
/etc/zarafa/license/base, /etc/zarafa/license/*
.RS 4
The base file contains your license key\&. When you have extra CAL license keys, these are found in the other files available in the license/ directory, one key per file\&. This directory is configurable\&.
.RE
.PP
Configuration options for user plugins are in their respective configuration file\&. The name of these files is set in the server\&.cfg file\&. See
\fBzarafa-server.cfg\fR(5)
for information on the server\&.cfg settings\&.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
If you run into problems, check the log for any errors\&. If you made a mistake in the configuration of the log method, this will be reported on standard error\&. You can also restart the server with a higher log level\&. Also, before starting the server, always make sure the database server is running at the right location and no other server is listening on the configured TCP port\&.
.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
The normal way for user clients to connect to the server is over TCP, either direct using the Zarafa port, or over HTTP when Apache is setup as a proxy\&. Users can only login with their username and password\&.
.PP
The normal way for admin clients, like the spooler and admin tool, to connect to the server is through the Unix socket on Unix type servers\&. The admin clients are able to login when they are run as root or as the user the Zarafa server process is running as\&. Most of the time this will be root only, since the Zarafa server process runs as root by default\&.
.PP
As an exception for the dagent, a unix user can also connect to it\*(Aqs own store without a password\&. Any other store cannot be accessed this way\&.
.PP
Direct SSL connections are also possible\&. The server needs to be configured to accept SSL connections on a new port\&. Login via an SSL key is also possible\&. Please read the next section on how to setup SSL\&.
.SH "SSL"
.PP
To accept SSL connections directly by the server, the Zarafa server will need to listen on a different port to separate the normal connections from the encrypted connections\&. This is set in the
\fIserver_ssl_port\fR
setting in the configuration file\&.
.PP
Then, you must setup a signed SSL certificate\&. First, we\*(Aqll create a Certificate Authority to be able to sign certificate requests\&. We provide a script which makes it easy to create certificates on any distribution\&. This script is located in /usr/share/zarafa, called ssl\-certificate\&.sh\&. Enter the following commands to create a certificate for the Zarafa server\&.
.PP

\fB mkdir \-p /etc/zarafa/ssl \fR
\fB cd /etc/zarafa/ssl \fR
\fB sh /usr/share/zarafa/ssl\-certificate\&.sh server \fR
.PP
Press enter twice to start the creation of a new CA, probably called demoCA\&. Enter a password when asked for\&. This is the password later used to sign certificate requests\&. Then enter your certificate information\&. Do not leave the Common Name field blank, otherwise the creation will fail\&. A good example for the Common Name field is your hostname\&.
.PP
Now that we have a CA, we can create self\-signed certificates\&. The script will automatically start the creation of this certificate\&. The CA certificate must be set in the server\&.cfg file in the
\fIserver_ssl_ca_file\fR
setting\&. We need a signed certificate for the server to start with SSL support\&.
.PP
Enter a password for the request, and enter the certificate details\&. Some details need to be different from what you typed when creating the CA\&. Type at least a different name in the \*(AqOrganizational Unit Name\*(Aq field\&. The challenge password at the end may be left empty\&.
.PP
The script will automatically continue with signing this certificate request\&. You will need to enter your CA certificate password again to sign this request\&. Then you must accept the new certificate into the CA\&.
.PP
After accepting, a new signed certificate is created, with the name server\&.pem\&. This file contains the private key, so keep this file safe\&.
.PP
The script will ask if a public key should also be created\&. Since we\*(Aqre creating the certificate for the server, this is not needed\&. So enter \*(Aqn\*(Aq and press enter\&.
.PP
The server\&.pem file should be set in the server\&.cfg file in the
\fIserver_ssl_key_file\fR
option\&. See
\fBzarafa-server.cfg\fR(5)
for information on the possible SSL settings\&. The password of this key needs to be set in the
\fIserver_ssl_key_pass\fR
option\&. Do not forget this password in the server\&.cfg file, otherwise the zarafa\-server program will ask for this password when an SSL connection is accepted\&.
.PP
To create a new certificate for a client service, run the script again\&. You can create one new certificate for all clients, or seperate certificates for each client\&.
.PP

\fB sh /usr/share/zarafa/ssl\-certificates\&.sh \fR
.PP
When typing the certificate information, type at least a different \*(AqOrganizational Unit Name\*(Aq field\&. When asked for a public key, type \*(Aqy\*(Aq and enter to create the public key\&.
.PP
Install the new service\&.pem on the server that will be logging in\&. Install the service\-public\&.pem file in the /etc/zarafa/sslkeys directory:
.PP

\fB mkdir /etc/zarafa/sslkeys \fR
\fB mv service\-public\&.pem /etc/zarafa/sslkeys \fR
.PP
The remote service, which has the service\&.pem private key, can now login with the certificate, because the known public key matches\&.
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
The following signals can be sent to the Zarafa server process:
.PP
\fBHUP\fR
.RS 4
When the HUP signal is received, some options from the configuration file are reloaded\&. The reloadable options are listed in the
\fBzarafa-server.cfg\fR(5)
manual page\&.
.sp
Also, when using
\fIlog_method = file\fR, the logfile will be closed and a new logfile will be opened\&. You can use this signal in your logrotate system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBTERM\fR
.RS 4
To gracefully let the server exit, the normal TERM signal is used\&. Because of open sessions by clients it may take up to 60 seconds for the server to completely shutdown\&.
.RE
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
Written by Zarafa\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
