.SH "NAME"
za-restore \- Restore all stubbed and removed messages in a primary store with the messages found in the currently or previously attached archives(s)\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBza\-restore\fR\ 'u
\fBza\-restore\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...] [\fIUSER\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
za\-restore can be used to repopulate a primary store to a state where no archive is required to read any message\&. In a less cryptic way this means that all stubbed messages are destubbed and all messages that were deleted after archiving are restored\&.
.PP
The advantage of using za\-restore over dragging the messages back from the archive in Outlook or Webaccess is that the restores messages are sanitized, allowing them to be properly rearchived later\&.
.SH "STRATEGY"
.PP
The strategy taken by za\-restore is that it iterates through all folder in the primary store, and tries to open the archive folders that are attached to that store\&. There can be more than one attached archive folder, and these folders are not required to exist in an archive that is currently attached\&. So folders of previously used archives will be restored as well if they still exist\&.
.PP
Once the archives have been resolved, za\-restore will create a list of restorable messages based on the reference entryid found in the archived copies\&. When multiple archives are found, multiple archived copies for the same primary message can exist\&. In that case za\-restore will choose the most recent one\&.
.PP
Once the list of restorable messages is complete, za\-restore will start restoring by first determining if the primary message, referenced by the reference entryid from the archived copies exist and if so if it is stubbed\&. If the primary message exists and is not stubbed, there\*(Aqs no need to restore anything\&. If the message exists but is stubbed, it will be destubbed\&. If the primary message does not exist, a new message is created based on the archived copy\&. In this case the archived copy is updated so it will reference the newly created message\&. This is needed to make sure a subsequent run of za\-restore won\*(Aqt create another copy\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h\fR \fIserverpath\fR
.RS 4
Host to connect with\&.

.sp
Default:
\fIza\-restore\&.log\fR
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-detach\fR
.RS 4
Detach the selected or all archive stores before starting the restore procedure\&. This avoids the archiver from re archiving restored messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unhook\fR
.RS 4
Unhook the selected ot all archive stores once the restore process has completed\&. This implies \-\-detach and only works on archive stores\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-remove\fR
.RS 4
Remove the selected ot all archive stores once the restore process has completed\&. This implies\-\-unhook and only works on archive stores\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-select\-source\fR
.RS 4
Select the source archive(s) by providing a comma seperated list of archive indexes\&. The indexes specify which archives to restore from\&. The \-\-detach, \-\-unhook and \-\-remove options only apply to the selected archives\&."
.sp
The archive indexes can be obtained by listing the attached archives for a user: zarafa\-archiver \-u

.RS 4
Increase console loglevel\&. Can be specified multiple times\&.
