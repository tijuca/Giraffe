.SH "NAME"
zarafa-gateway.cfg \- The Zarafa gateway configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBgateway\&.cfg\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fIgateway\&.cfg\fR
is a configuration file for the Zarafa Gateway\&.
\fIgateway\&.cfg\fR
contains instructions for the software to set up the logging system and to enable or disable the POP3, POP3S, IMAP or IMAPS part of the service\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of one big section, but parameters can be grouped by functionality\&.
.PP
The parameters are written in the form:
.PP
\fBname\fR
=
\fIvalue\fR
.PP
The file is line\-based\&. Each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, nothing, a parameter or a directive\&. A line beginning with `#\' is considered a comment, and will be ignored by Zarafa\&. Parameter names are case sensitive\&. Lines beginning with `!\' are directives\&.
.PP
Directives are written in the form:
.PP
!\fBdirective\fR
\fI[argument(s)] \fR
.PP
The following directives exist:
.PP
\fBinclude\fR
.RS 4
Include and process
\fIargument\fR
.sp
Example: !include common\&.cfg
.RE
.SH "EXPLANATION OF EACH PARAMETER"
.PP
\fBserver_bind\fR
.RS 4
IP address to bind to\&. 0\&.0\&.0\&.0 for any address\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI0\&.0\&.0\&.0\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_hostname\fR
.RS 4
Hostname of the server to print to a client in the logon greeting\&. Leave empty to use DNS to find the hostname\&.
.sp
Default:
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_hostname_greeting\fR
.RS 4
Whether to show the hostname in the logon greeting to clients\&. This config option is reloadable using the HUP signal\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBpop3_enable\fR
.RS 4
Enable POP3 service with value yes\&. All other values disable the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBpop3_port\fR
.RS 4
The POP3 service will listen on this port for incoming connections\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI110\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBpop3s_enable\fR
.RS 4
Enable POP3S service with value yes\&. All other values disable the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBpop3s_port\fR
.RS 4
The POP3S service will listen on this port for incoming connections\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI995\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_enable\fR
.RS 4
Enable IMAP service with value yes\&. All other values disable the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_port\fR
.RS 4
The IMAP service will listen on this port for incoming connections\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI143\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimaps_enable\fR
.RS 4
Enable IMAPS service with value yes\&. All other values disable the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimaps_port\fR
.RS 4
The IMAPS service will listen on this port for incoming connections\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI993\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBserver_socket\fR
.RS 4
The http address of the Zarafa server\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIhttp://localhost:236/zarafa\fR
.sp
It is not advised to specify the UNIX socket here, but the http address instead\&. In default configuration the gateway will then be trusted by the Zarafa server (as set in its local_admin_users configuration setting)\&. Unless is run as an untrusted user, by specifying the
\fBrun_as_user\fR, the gateway always authenticates users even if they provide no or wrong credentials!
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_user\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the gateway process will become this user, dropping root privileges\&. Note that the log file needs to be writeable by this user, and the directory too to create new logfiles after logrotation\&. This can also be achieved by setting the correct group and permissions\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the user after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrun_as_group\fR
.RS 4
After correctly starting, the gateway process will become this group, dropping root privileges\&.
.sp
Default value is empty, not changing the group after starting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpid_file\fR
.RS 4
Write the process ID number to this file\&. This is used by the init\&.d script to correctly stop/restart the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/run/zarafa\-gateway\&.pid\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBrunning_path\fR
.RS 4
Change directory to this path when running in daemonize mode\&. When using the \-F switch to run in the foreground the directory will not be changed\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBprocess_model\fR
.RS 4
You can change the process model between
\fIfork\fR
and
\fIthread\fR\&. The forked model uses somewhat more resources, but if a crash is triggered, this will only affect one user\&. In the threaded model, a crash means all users are affected, and will not be able to use the service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIfork\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_only_mailfolders\fR
.RS 4
Enable the IMAP and IMAPS service to only show the mailfolders\&. This is the default behaviour\&. When this option is set to \'no\', you will also be able to select you calendar and contacts and such\&. These views will not contain all information, since these items cannot be converted to a rfc\-822 mail item\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_public_folders\fR
.RS 4
Enable the IMAP and IMAPS service to also show the public store with subfolders\&. This is the default behaviour\&. When this option is set to \'no\', IMAP clients will only see the users\' folder\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_capability_idle\fR
.RS 4
Allow IMAP clients to issue the IDLE command\&. When an IMAP client is idle, it may receive notifications from the server about changes of the selected folder\&. This may increase load on the server when many users are using the IMAP service\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_generate_utf8\fR
.RS 4
Normally e\-mails specify the correct charset for their contents\&. This may be altered to make it always UTF\-8\&. This will only happen on e\-mails that do not have the extra imap data properties, which is true for users without the \'imap\' feature enabled\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_max_messagesize\fR
.RS 4
Limit the maximum message size (in bytes) which can be created by an IMAP client\&. The maximum of this value is 4GB although this is not recommended\&. If the value is too high it will cause a segmentation fault\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI134217728\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_expunge_on_delete\fR
.RS 4
Normally when you delete an e\-mail in an IMAP client, it will only be marked as deleted, and not removed from the folder\&. The client should send the EXPUNGE command to actually remove the item from the folder (where Zarafa will place it in the soft\-delete system)\&. When this option is set to
\fIyes\fR, the zarafa\-gateway will issue the expunge command itself directly after a \'mark as delete\' command was received\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBimap_store_rfc822\fR
.RS 4
Store the rfc822 data with the message in MAPI\&. The Zarafa Gateway stores the original rfc822 data of an APPENDed message in the database for later retrieval\&. This makes sure that the exact message that was delivered into the Zarafa gateway is available for retrieval later, which is the behaviour when set to
\fIyes\fR\&. If set to no, the zarafa\-gateway will not store the original rfc822 text\&. This means that the rfc822 data must be re\-created when retrieved\&. This may cause changes in encoding or charset and some loss of fidelity\&. This will also invalidate any signatures in the stored messages\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIyes\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_private_key_file\fR
.RS 4
The gateway will use this file as private key for SSL TLS\&. This file can be created with:
\fBopenssl genrsa \-out /etc/zarafa/gateway/privkey\&.pem 2048\fR\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/gateway/privkey\&.pem\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_certificate_file\fR
.RS 4
The gateway will use this file as certificate for SSL TLS\&. A self\-signed certificate can be created with:
\fBopenssl req \-new \-x509 \-key /etc/zarafa/gateway/privkey\&.pem \-out /etc/zarafa/gateway/cert\&.pem \-days 1095\fR\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/etc/zarafa/gateway/cert\&.pem\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_verify_client\fR
.RS 4
Enable client certificate verification with value yes\&. All other values disable the verification\&.
.sp
Default:
\fIno\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_verify_file\fR
.RS 4
The file to verify the clients certificates with\&.
.sp
Default: value not set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBssl_verify_path\fR
.RS 4
The path with the files to verify the clients certificates with\&.
.sp
Default: value not set\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_method\fR
.RS 4
The method which should be used for logging\&. Valid values are:
.PP
\fIsyslog\fR
.RS 4
Use the Linux system log\&. All messages will be written to the mail facility\&. See also
\fBsyslog.conf\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Log to a file\&. The filename will be specified in
\fBlog_file\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
Default:
\fIfile\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_file\fR
.RS 4
When logging to a file, specify the filename in this parameter\&. Use
\fI\-\fR
(minus sign) for stderr output\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI/var/log/zarafa/gateway\&.log\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_level\fR
.RS 4
The level of output for logging in the range from 0 to 5\&. 0=no logging, 5=full logging\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI2\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBlog_timestamp\fR
.RS 4
Specify whether to prefix each log line with a timestamp in \'file\' logging mode\&.
.sp
Default:
\fI1\fR
