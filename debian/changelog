  [ Carsten Schoenert ]
  * [46d25ff] New upstream version 8.5.0
    Upstream version 8.5.0 has changes to getting successful built with
    libical3. (Closes: #883957)
  * [0006cb3] kopano-libs.symbols: update symbols to 8.5.0
  * [5df0116] Build-Depends: use php-dev instead of php7.0-dev
    We previously wanted to use PHP7.0, now that PHP7.2 has entered unstable
    and the kopanocore source is able to work also with PHP7.2 we can switch
    to virtual package php-dev. (Closes: #881010)
  * [309dc85] debian/rules: tuning the build rules a bit for using PHP7.2
    Make the build environment more flexible so we don't need to change PHP
    related versions later in various places and use instead variables for that.

    Make that sequencer file use the variables from above commit.
